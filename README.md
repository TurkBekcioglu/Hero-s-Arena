A competitive, 2-player strategy game where players create teams of three heroes and use the unique skills and abilities of their heroes to defeat their opponent.

  

Hero's Arena was originally designed as a table top game but was converted to a digital format using the Unity Engine.

 

Roles:

- Collaborated with a team of programmers to create a digital version of the physical board game prototype Heroâ€™s Arena, self-designed, on the Unity Engine.
- Concentrated on the design and code involving the characters; including combat, skills, movement and player-to-player interactions.
Designed and created sprites for characters and their abilities.
- Assisted with design and implementation of turn based mechanics and UI.

For the most part, I spent my time between creating sprites, implementing the playable charactersm and collaborating with teammates. 


HOW TO PLAY:

TEAM SELECTION:
- Each player picks three characters to create their team.
- Player one chooses first and then player two, this continues back and forth until each player has chosen three characters.
- The first character added to a team is the "Captain" of that team."

GAMEPLAY:
- The game itself is turn based (similar to chess) the character to be active in the next turn is based on what order you added them to your team. The round ends when all characters have had a turn.
- Player one moves their units using the WASD keys and Player two with the arrow keys.
- To use character skills players can press the buttons on their respective side of the screen (the buttons change whenever a her is activated), if the skill requires targeting use the movement keys to select the target.

OBJECTIVE:
- Each team's objective is to defeat the opposing teams captain. Once a team's captain has been defeated (when their HP = 0) the game is over.
