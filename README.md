A competitive, 2-player strategy game where players create teams of three heroes and use the unique skills and abilities of their heroes to defeat their opponent.

  

Hero's Arena was originally designed as a table top game but was converted to a digital format using the Unity Engine.

 

Roles:

Collaborated with a team of programmers to create a digital version of the physical board game prototype Heroâ€™s Arena, self-designed, on the Unity Engine.
Concentrated on the design and code involving the characters; including combat, skills, movement and player-to-player interactions.
Designed and created sprites for characters and their abilities.
Assisted with design and implementation of turn based mechanics and UI.
For the most part, I spent my time between creating sprites, implementing the playable charactersm and collaborating with teammates.
